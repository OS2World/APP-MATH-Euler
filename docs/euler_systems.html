<H1>Supported Systems</H1>
<P>Euler has started in 1988 on the Atari ST. However, this computer and the program version for it are long outdated.
I once had even a DOS version, which was very, very restricted.</P>
<P>This description contains download links too. Note, that Euler is distributed according to the GNU general public
license. Also note the usual disclaimer contained in this documentation.</P>
<h3>Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP</h3>
<P>This is one of the main versions. I did the interface using Borland C++ in 1994, 
but the recent sources are for Visual C++. The interface is in notebook
style with editable commands, comments and the Euler output. In this version, Euler graphics can be copied to the
clipboard in WMF format and saved as bitmaps, or as postscript files. The version supports sound output to wave
files, and can play an external wave file. The registry is used to keep user settings, and the windows sizes and
positions.</P>
<P>The documentation is contained in a HTML file, which is installed along with 
the program and linked from the start menu. The Windows help file contains only 
a hint to the HTML documentation.</P>
<P>Installation is done by a <a href="Download/euler95i.exe">setup program</a>,
which was created with <A HREF="http://www.digicron.com/jordanr/" target="_blank">I</A><A HREF="http://www.digicron.com/jordanr/"
target="_top">nno Setup</A>.</P>
<h3>Unix / Linux Version</h3>
<P>The version for Unix is based on Gtk, and was done by <A HREF="mailto:bouchare.eric@wanadoo.fr">
Eric Boucaré</A> from France in 2001. Many, many thanks to him for doing this. 
For recent developments, see his the <A HREF="http://euler.sourceforge.net/"
target="_blank">pages on Sourceforge</A> he made. My old Unix version is 
outdated and will no longer be supported.</P>
<P>The version is similar to the Windows version, and uses a notebook window. 
The source is diverging from my source in quite some places. To compile that 
version you will need the Gtk development files. On Linux, a simple make will be 
enough.</P>
<H3>OS/2 Version</H3>
<P>Lacking a working OS/2 system, I stopped maintaining this version in 1996. I wrote it back in 1993. You can
still download a <a href="Download/euleros2.zip">build</a> from our server.</P>
