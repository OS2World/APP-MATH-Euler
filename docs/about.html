<P>EULER is a program for quick and interactive
computations with real and complex numbers, matrices, or with intervals. EULER can draw functions in two and three
dimensions. It contains a programming language.</P>
<P>In general, EULER is a numerical matrix system. It is not a MatLab clone, but very similar to this
program.</P>
<P>Euler comes with Yacas, a computer algebra system. So you can combine fast 
numerical computations with symbolic computations.</P>
<P>The Copyright on EULER remains with the program author. The source is available according to the GNU general
public license. This license allows you to do whatever you like with Euler or parts of its source code, provided
your code is as free as Euler. Other licenses are available.</P>
