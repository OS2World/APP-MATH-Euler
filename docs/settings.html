<H1>Special Settings</H1>
<P>This description mentions some special things. Many of the things special to Windows apply also for
the new Unix GTK version done by Eric Bouchar&eacute;.</P>
<H3>Stack Size</H3>
<P>Euler uses a stack of fixed size. The stack contains all computed elements, and the local variables of the active
functions. To set the stack size in Windows, use the menu. The new stack size will be effective at the next start
of Euler. In Unix, use the command line option &quot;-s&quot; to set the stack size.</P>
<H3>Graphics Size</H3>
<P>Graphics are stored in an internal format. The area used to store graphics is limited. You can change the size
of this are in Windows with a menu entry.</P>
<H3>Fonts</H3>
<P>There are two fonts. One for the text, and one for the graphics. In Windows, there is a comfortable dialog to
edit both of these fonts. The fonts will be scaled with the graphics window size, if possible. In Unix, you will
have to use the command line to choose a fixed font.</P>
<H3>Colors</H3>
<P>Euler uses 16 colors. In Windows, you can edit all colors with a menu entry. The first two should be black and
white, since they are used for basic text output. Colors 2 and 3 are used most often, also for text output, and
should be green and red. The option to use pure colors only is somewhat outdated, since most systems run on a real
color basic now.</P>
<H3>Printing</H3>
<P>The Windows version can print graphics directly. It can also print a comment below the graphics. In Unix, it
is best to save as postscript as described in the graphics section, and to print the postscript or use it in TeX.</P>
<H3>The Clipboard</H3>
<P>In Windows, text, command and graphics can be saved to the clipboard. When saving text, there is a choice between
commands and all text. Selecting text for the clipboard is done in the usual way by dragging over the text with
the mouse. Commands can be used to generate an external Euler file. Graphics are copied in Windows Metafile Format.</P>
<H3>Saving Graphics</H3>
<P>Graphics can be saved as postscript by all versions of Euler. The procedure is described <A HREF="graphics.html">here</A>.
The Windows version can save graphics in Windows Metafile Format and in Bitmap format. In Unix, one can use the
usual screen dump features to get a dump of the graphics screen.</P>
<H3>Delete Euler Output</H3>
<P>In Windows, the output of the Euler system can be deleted. This can either be done for the selected region,
or for the complete file.
