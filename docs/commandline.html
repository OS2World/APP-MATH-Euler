<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><span lang="en-us">Using the EULER <A NAME="windows"></A>windows</span></H2>
<P><span lang="en-us">EULER uses two windows. The <EM>text window</EM> and the <EM>graphics window</EM>. 
You
can switch between these windows with the TAB key. You can alternatively use the 
mouse to click into one of the windows, of course.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">The text window contains the menu and is used for user input and output of EULER. 
The input and output is organized in &quot;notebooks&quot; (see below).</span><P>
<span lang="en-us">The graphics window is displayed,
whenever EULER draws to it. It remains visible as long as there is no text output. EULER
pops the text screen to the foreground as soon as some procedure prints text.
</span>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><span lang="en-us"><A NAME="Notebooks"></A>Notebooks</span></H2>
<P><span lang="en-us">Notebooks contain the commands, comments and EULER output. Old commands can 
be edited and changed. A comment may be added to each command using a built-in 
editor. </span> </P>
<P><span lang="en-us">Notebook files are useful for communication of Euler computations
to other people, or to archive documented computations. Collections of functions 
should still be kept in program files (see below), which, however, may be loaded 
in the first commands of a notebook. A notebook could accompany program files,
and explain the use of the functions with examples. Another idea is to use notebooks for teaching mathematics.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">The most important fact about notebooks is that EULER still uses the sequence of commands as they are executed.
So if you change the value of a variable later and then go to previous command, the changed value is used.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">You may not only change previous commands, but also delete them or insert new commands. Use the notebook menu
to do this, or the keyboard shortcuts. If you change a command and execute it, its output is removed and EULER
proceeds to the next command, unless you toggle a switch to insert  new commands. In this case, a new command is inserted
after the one you just executed.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">You can delete the output of commands. To do this, select a text area and use the command in the notebook menu.
All output of the selected commands will be deleted.</span></P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><span lang="en-us">The <A NAME="Command"></A>Command Line</span></H2>
<P><span lang="en-us">Text can be entered behind the prompt (&gt;) using the keyboard. Letters can be cancelled with
the Backspace key. The cursor keys position the cursor back and forth in the line. The line editor is always in
insert mode, so any character is inserted at the current cursor position. The 
Home and End keys work as usual. Escape clears all input. Shift plus -&gt; or&lt; - 
position the cursor one word to the right or left. Finally, the input is 
executed
by pressing Return.&nbsp; EULER will then start to interpret the command. The cursor can be at any position of the input
line, when Return is pressed.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">Previous input can be re-called with Shift and the Cursor-Up and Cursor-Down keys. 
If a command is recalled this way and executed with Return, Cursor-Down recalls the next command;
i.e., Cursor-Up and Cursor-Down are always based on the last recalled command. Clearing the input line also makes
the last command the base for recalling (use Escape or Control-Cursor-Up). Thus Escape plus 
Cursor-Up recalls the
previous command.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">Pressing the Insert key extends incomplete commands. Pressing this key again gives another extension, if there
is one. The search goes through the command history, the implemented functions, the user defined functions and
the built-in commands in that order.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">The End key will insert the text &quot;endfunction&quot;, but only on empty lines in programming mode (see below).
Otherwise, it works as usual.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">There are some other special keys. The Tabulator key switches to the Graphics screen and from there any key
switches back. The Escape key stops any running EULER program and some internal functions, like the 3-dimensional
plots, the linear equation solver and the polynomial root finder.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">The Page-Up and Page-Down keys works as usual.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">Input can spread over several lines using &quot;..&quot;. The two dots are allowed at any place, where
a space is acceptable. E.g.</span></P>
<PRE><span lang="en-us">    &gt;3+ .. some comment
    &gt;4</span></PRE>
<P><span lang="en-us">is equivalent to</span></P>
<PRE><span lang="en-us">    &gt;3+4</span></PRE>
<P><span lang="en-us">Comments can follow the &quot;..&quot; and are skipped.</span></P>
<H3><span lang="en-us">Function Keys</span></H3>
<P><span lang="en-us">The function keys may be programmed by</span></P>
<PRE><span lang="en-us">    &gt;setkey(number,&quot;text&quot;);</span></PRE>
<P><span lang="en-us">The number must be between 1 and 10 and the &quot;text&quot; may be any EULER string. Then the corresponding
function key will produce the text, when it is pressed together with the ALT key . If the function key text is
to contain the &quot; character, one can use double quotes as string delimiters as in</span></P>
<PRE><span lang="en-us">    &gt;setkey(1,''load &quot;test&quot;;'');</span></PRE>
<P><span lang="en-us">which puts</span></P>
<PRE><span lang="en-us">    &gt;load &quot;test&quot;;</span></PRE>
<P><span lang="en-us">on the function key Shift-F1. </span>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><span lang="en-us"><A NAME="Loading"></A>Euler Files</span></H2>
<P><span lang="en-us">To abbreviate tedious input one may generate a file containing EULER input. 
Such files can be generated with
any editor. To load that file enter</span></P>
<PRE><span lang="en-us">    &gt;load filename
</span></PRE>
<P><span lang="en-us">All lines of that file are interpreted just as any other input from the keyboard. Also a loaded file may itself
contain a load command. If an error occurs, the loading is stopped and an error message is displayed. There is
a default extension &quot;.e&quot;, which you should use for these files. You need not specify this extension in
the load command. The filename may be included in double quotes. If you are using a string expression, include
it in round brackets.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">The best use of an Euler program file is to define functions in those files. 
Many predefined functions are loaded at each program start. EULER will load the file euler.cfg everytime the program
starts. This file does again contain load commands, which load the necessary utility files.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">EULER looks for the specified file in the active directory by default. You may specify a path with the path
statement</span></P>
<PRE><span lang="en-us">    &gt;path &quot;...&quot;</span></PRE>
<P><span lang="en-us">where the string  contains a path like &quot;.;myspecial&quot;. This would put the active directory into
the path and a subdirectory named myspecial. The path command is useful for network setups.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">A file may contain comments. Comments look like this</span></P>
<PRE><span lang="en-us">comment
This is a comment.
Comments can spread several lines.

Also empty lines are allowed.
endcomment</span></PRE>
<P><span lang="en-us">endcomment must be the first string of a line.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">You can turn comment printing off with</span></P>
<PRE><span lang="en-us">comment off</span></PRE>
<P><span lang="en-us">Otherwise all comments in a file are displayed, when the file is loaded.</span></P>
<PRE><span lang="en-us">comment on
</span></PRE>
<P><span lang="en-us">turns this feature on.</span></P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><span lang="en-us">Euler <A NAME="Errors"></A>Errors</span></H2>
<P><span lang="en-us">If a computation error occurs, Euler will issue an error message and try to print the offending input. This
may either be a place in your input from the command line, a command line in a loaded file, or a line in an EULER
function. In the latter case, Euler will print a stack dump of function calls.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">You can generate an error yourself and print an error message with</span></P>
<PRE><span lang="en-us">error(&quot;An error occured&quot;);</span></PRE>
<P><span lang="en-us">If this line is in an Euler function, execution will be stopped, and the normal error routine is called, generating
a stack dump.</span></P>
<P><span lang="en-us">It is also possible to test an expression for errors. This will not generate error messages (indeed it will
suppress all output), and return an error code and, if available, a result. An example is</span></P>
<PRE><span lang="en-us">{n,B}=errorlevel(&quot;inv(A)&quot;);</span></PRE>
<P><span lang="en-us">The matrix A will be inverted to B, if possible, and n will contain 0. If the inversion fails, n will contain
an error number different from 0. The variable B may not be used in this case. Use</span></P>
<PRE><span lang="en-us">if n&lt;&gt;0; error(&quot;Inversion failed&quot;); endif;</span></PRE>
<P><span lang="en-us">to pass an error to the user.</span></BODY></HTML>
